    "# Analysing steps in a short walk using acceleration and rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this noteboook we examine a recording from the Arduino IMU of a short walk with the aim to extract the step count, cadence and timings including ground time and step duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement three techniques outlined in the paper `A comprehensive comparison of simple step counting techniques using wrist- and ankle-mounted accelerometer and gyroscope signals` by Matthew Rudy and Joseph Mahoney - [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325451208_A_comprehensive_comparison_of_simple_step_counting_techniques_using_wrist-_and_ankle-mounted_accelerometer_and_gyroscope_signals](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325451208_A_comprehensive_comparison_of_simple_step_counting_techniques_using_wrist-_and_ankle-mounted_accelerometer_and_gyroscope_signals).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Peak-finding\n",
    "* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\n",
    "* Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods allows us to count steps. The peak-finding method also identifies where the steps occur in the timeseries, so this in turn allows us to isolate steps and calculate such things as ground time and step duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The IMU\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino Nano inertial measurement unit gives us acceleration, measured in `g`s (`1g = 9.8m/s/s`), and rotation (angular velocity). In this notebook we demonstrate how to extract steps from either acceleration or rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect a CSV file with columns for time, 3 axes of acceleration, and 3 axes of gyroscopic rotation.\n",
