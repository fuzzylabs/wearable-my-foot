# AI For Your Feet

This is a project to track gait, posture and exercise with wearable _things_. The project covers a full AI stack, from hardware to models to cloud-deployed web services.

AI For Your Feet, also known as *Wearable, [my foot](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/my_foot)* is built by [Fuzzy Labs](https://fuzzylabs.ai).

## Hardware

The hardware is based on an [Arduino Nano IOT microcontroller](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot).

n.b. the current generation of hardware is a prototype. Future iterations will have a better form-factor by using smaller components. Example product links are included for purchasing the components.

* Wires: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elegoo-120pcs-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino-colorful/dp/B01EV70C78/
* Arduino Nano IOT microcontroller: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arduino-Nano-IoT-headers-mounted/dp/B07WPFQZQ1/
* Resistors: 3x 10kohm
* Pressure sensors: https://uk.farnell.com/ohmite/fsr04be/force-sensing-resistor-02ah9085/dp/3216598

## Microcontroller code

The code for the Arduino is built using PlatformIO.

In the [arduino-nano](arduino-nano) (for pressure sensing code) or [arduino-nano-powermetre](arduino-nano-powermetre) (for power metre)  directory:

### Optional Virtualenv setup

Feel free to skip if you're installing / have installed PlatformIO using a different method. To initialise the environment using Python 3 and `pip`:

```
python -m venv env
env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To activate the environment, `source env/bin/activate`.

### Building and deploying to the device

To *Just build*

```
platformio run
```

*Build and upload*

```
platformio run -t upload
```

*Attach a serial monitor*

```
platformio run -t monitor
```

*Run the tests* - this builds a new image and uploads it so that tests are run on the device

```
platformio test
```

## Android app

The Android app allows the device to connect via Bluetooth and upload data. It's written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).

### Building and deploying via Android Studio

0. Enable the development mode on your Android device, and connect the device with a USB cable
1. Clone or download the repository code
2. Open the project in Android Studio (File > Open)
3. Run the app (Shift+F10 or Run > Run 'app'), this might display a prompt on the Android device to confirm that you trust the computer (if it is not on the trusted list yet)

### Screen sharing Android device on linx

TODO (scrcpy)

### Usage
0. Have the Arduino powered on
1. Open the app. The app will request access to location data, which is required for Bluetooth scanning.
2. Tap 'Scan' to scan for BLE devices, if the compatible device is found, its MAC address will be displayed on the screen.
3. Tap 'Connect' to connect to the Arduino. After successful connection, the orange LED will light up on the Arduino, and current readings will be displayed on the screen.
4. Tap 'Disconnect' to disconnect and end the session.
5. Tap 'Save' to save the results of the session into a CSV file (saved at `Android/data/ai.fuzzylabs.wearablemyfoot/files/` on the Android device

## Jupyter notebooks

[notebooks](notebooks) directory contains notebooks with code used in the experiments

* powermetre.ipynb -- the notebook for estimating the power of a walk in a straight path. Requires three CSV files
  - Measurements of acceleration when the device is at rest for calibration (provided at [data/still.csv](data/still.csv)
  - Measurements of acceleration during a walk with the Arduino mounted on a chest (can be recorded with the provided app, and the sample data is provided at [data/chest3.csv](data/chest3.csv)
  - Measurements of acceleration during a walk taken with the Android device for comparison (provided at [data/chest-android.csv](data/chest-android.csv)

### Versioning the notebooks

See [here](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/how-to-version-control-jupyter) for a nice description of the problems associated with versioning Jupyter notebooks and some suggested solutions.

We're using [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to remove the outputs and state data from the committed versions of our notebooks.

```
nbstripout --install
nbstripout --install --attributes .gitattributes
nbstripout --install --global
nbstripout --status
```

## Results
### Cadence
Mean average cadence (in steps per minute) recorded with different methods:
Test case|Stryd|Garmin|(WMF) Peak Detection|(WMF) FFT|(WMF) Autocorrelation
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
1km mixed run| 82.56| 82.48| 71.50| 170.17| 154.48

## Data

The [data](data) directory contains some example data generated by the device.

### Power measurements
Several sample CSV files containing IMU measurements (acceleration and angular velocity)
* `still.csv` -- several minutes of the devices sitting still on a table; used to assess the accuracy and the bias of the IMU
* `leg.csv` -- a short walk with the device strapped to a side of a leg
* `chest3.csv` -- a short walk (4.5 metres) with the device attached to a chest
* `chest-android.csv` -- a short walk (4.5 metres) recorded with an Android phone (at the same time as `chest3.csv`) 

## Data dashboard (Dash)

The [dash](dash) directory contains a dashboard generated by the [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash) framework. Dash is Python-based, and uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) web framework; Dash is similar to [R-Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com).

### Running locally
